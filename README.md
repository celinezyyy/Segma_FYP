# Final Year Project (Segma)

**Topic: A WEB-BASED MARKET SEGMENTATION MODEL FOR SMALL ENTERPRISES**

This project developed a web-based market segmentation system to help small enterprises better understand their customers and make data-driven marketing decisions. Existing segmentation tools are often complex, require technical expertise, or lack features for non-technical users. This system addresses these gaps by combining AI-driven customer segmentation with a user-friendly interface.

The platform supports hybrid and posteriori segmentation, performs behavioral, demographic, and geographic analysis, and provides interactive dashboards and PDF report generation. Users can explore hidden patterns in customer behavior without requiring technical expertise.
