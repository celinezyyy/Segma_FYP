**Web-Based Market Segmentation System**

This is my Final Year Project (FYP) – a web-based tool for small businesses (SMEs) to analyze their customers. It uses AI-driven segmentation to group customers based on behavior and preferences, helping businesses create personalized marketing strategies.

Features include:
- User login and registration
- Profile management
- Dataset upload and selection
- Customer segmentation
- PDF report generation
- Feedback and admin management

This system allows SMEs to get actionable customer insights easily, without needing technical expertise.
